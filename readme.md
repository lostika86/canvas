## Introduction

A [Laravel](https://laravel.com) publishing platform. Canvas is a fully open source package to extend your existing application and get you up-and-running with a blog in 
just a few minutes. In addition to a distraction-free writing experience, you can view monthly trends on your content, 
get insights into reader traffic and more!

## Installation

> **Note:** Canvas requires you to have user authentication in place prior to installation. For Laravel 5.* based projects you may run the `make:auth` Artisan command to satisfy this requirement. For Laravel 6.* based projects please see the [official guide](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/authentication#introduction) to get started.   

You may use composer to install Canvas into your Laravel project:

```bash
composer require cnvs/canvas
```

Publish the assets and primary configuration file using the `canvas:install` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan canvas:install
```

Create a symbolic link to ensure file uploads are publicly accessible from the web using the `storage:link` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## Usage

### Configuration

After publishing Canvas's assets, a primary configuration file will be located at `config/canvas.php`. This file allows you to customize various aspects of how your application uses the package.

Canvas exposes a simple UI at `/canvas` by default. This can be changed by updating the `path` option:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Base Route
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is the URI path where Canvas will be accessible from. You are free
| to change this path to anything you like. Note that the URI will not
| affect the paths of its internal API that aren't exposed to users.
|
*/

'path' => env('CANVAS_PATH_NAME', 'canvas'),

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Route Middleware
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| These middleware will be attached to every route in Canvas, giving you
| the chance to add your own middleware to this list or change any of
| the existing middleware. Or, you can simply stick with the list.
|
*/

'middleware' => [
    'web',
    'auth',
],

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Storage
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is the storage disk Canvas will use to put file uploads. You may
| use any of the disks defined in the config/filesystems.php file and
| you may also change the maximum upload size from its 3MB default.
|
*/

'storage_disk' => env('CANVAS_STORAGE_DISK', 'local'),

'storage_path' => env('CANVAS_STORAGE_PATH', 'public/canvas'),

'upload_filesize' => env('CANVAS_UPLOAD_FILESIZE', 3145728),
```

### Publishing

> **Note:** If you'd rather have your front-end generated automatically, just use [this command](#want-to-get-started-fast) to get started.

Canvas takes care of the backend while giving you the freedom to display the final content however you choose. A very simple setup would include a controller, some views, and a few routes. Take a look at the following example:

Define a few routes inside of `routes/web.php`:

```php
// Get all published posts
Route::get('blog', 'BlogController@getPosts');

// Get posts for a given tag
Route::get('tag/{slug}', 'BlogController@getPostsByTag');

// Get posts for a given topic
Route::get('topic/{slug}', 'BlogController@getPostsByTopic');

// Find a single post
Route::middleware('Canvas\Http\Middleware\Session')->get('{slug}', 'BlogController@findPostBySlug');
```

Add the corresponding methods inside of a new `BlogController`:

```php
public function getPosts()
{
    $data = [
        'posts' => \Canvas\Post::published()->orderByDesc('published_at')->simplePaginate(10),
    ];

    return view('blog.index', compact('data'));
}
```

```php
public function getPostsByTag(string $slug)
{
    if (\Canvas\Tag::where('slug', $slug)->first()) {
        $data = [
            'posts' => \Canvas\Post::whereHas('tags', function ($query) use ($slug) {
                $query->where('slug', $slug);
            })->published()->orderByDesc('published_at')->simplePaginate(10),
        ];

        return view('blog.index', compact('data'));
    } else {
        abort(404);
    }
}
```

```php
public function getPostsByTopic(string $slug)
{
    if (\Canvas\Topic::where('slug', $slug)->first()) {
        $data = [
            'posts' => \Canvas\Post::whereHas('topic', function ($query) use ($slug) {
                $query->where('slug', $slug);
            })->published()->orderByDesc('published_at')->simplePaginate(10),
        ];

        return view('blog.index', compact('data'));
    } else {
        abort(404);
    }
}
```

```php
public function findPostBySlug(string $slug)
{
    $posts = \Canvas\Post::with('tags', 'topic')->published()->get();
    $post = $posts->firstWhere('slug', $slug);

    if (optional($post)->published) {
        $data = [
            'author' => $post->user,
            'post'   => $post,
            'meta'   => $post->meta,
        ];

        // IMPORTANT: This event must be called for tracking visitor/view traffic
        event(new \Canvas\Events\PostViewed($post));

        return view('blog.show', compact('data'));
    } else {
        abort(404);
    }
}
```

Finally, just create `index.blade.php` and `show.blade.php` inside a `/views/blog` directory to display your data.

## Options

> **Note:** The following components are optional features, you are not required to use them.

### Want to get started fast?

Just run `php artisan canvas:ui` after installing Canvas. Then, navigate your browser to `http://your-app.test/blog` or any other URL that is assigned to your application.

### Want access to the entire [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) library?

Set up a new application at [https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications), grab your access key, and update `config/canvas.php`:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Unsplash Integration
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Visit https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications to create a new Unsplash
| app. Use the confidential Access Key given to you to integrate with
| the API. Note that demo apps are limited to 50 requests per hour.
|
*/

'unsplash' => [
    'access_key' => env('CANVAS_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY'),
]
```

### Want a weekly summary?

Canvas allows users to receive a weekly summary of their authored content. Once your application is [configured for sending mail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/mail), update `config/canvas.php`:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| E-Mail Notifications
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This option controls e-mail notifications that will be sent via the
| default application mail driver. A default option is provided to
| support the notification system as an opt-in feature.
|
|
*/

'mail' => [
    'enabled' => env('CANVAS_MAIL_ENABLED', false),
]
```

Since the weekly digest runs on [Laravel's Scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling), you'll need to add the following cron entry to your server:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Updates

Canvas releases are versioned as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` numbers
- A major or minor version _can contain breaking changes_, so follow the [upgrade guide](upgrade.md) for a step-by-step breakdown
- Patch versions will remain backwards compatible, so you can safely update the package by following the steps below:

You may update your Canvas installation using composer:

```bash
composer update
```

Run any new migrations using the `migrate` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Re-publish the assets using the `canvas:publish` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan canvas:publish
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
composer test
```

## Translate

One of the goals for the team behind Canvas is to ensure proper localization across the app. If you come across any translation mistakes or issues and want to make a contribution, please [create a pull request](https://github.com/cnvs/canvas/pulls). If you don't see your native language included in the `resources/lang` directory, feel free to add it.
